Selected Completed No Starch Python Textbook Exercises that I redid for practice.  
***I have another repository of exercises from the same textbook, most of which are the same exercises. 
All problems were redone from scratch, and I added chapter 14 exercises. Thus the readme for this repository is essentially identical 
to that of the no_starch_python_exercises repository***
## Overview
These exercises are from the introductory python textbook *Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming* by Eric Matthes.
I completed the exercises while learning the language myself and have decided to upload them for the instruction of others. I am no expert, 
and thus read the solutions I've provided with a grain of salt. I tried hard to only use tools and code that had already introduced by the textbook for any given problem.
## Running code
All exercises from chapter 1 to chapter 11 only use libraries contained in the Python Standard Library. So if you have python3 and are using an editor that can handle
i/o operations then all exercises up to the point should be easy to run by compiling and executing.  
From chapter 12 to chapter 14 a library called pygame is required to run most programs. Basic instructions for installing pygame from another project follow:
### Installing Pygame
To download the latest version of python, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and follow the instructions for your OS.  
Your version of python will likely come with python's standard package installer, pip(package installer for python), but if it does not you can download it following the instructions at this link: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/    
Finally, if you have pip installed you should be able to use the command
`python3 -m pip install -U pygame`
in your command line to install pygame, but if this does not work and you want more detailed instructions go to https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted#Pygame%20Installation
## Notes
Most but not all exercises are included. Some that seemed more repetetive(compred to the previous question) and time-intensive than was worthwhile were skipped.  
**Good luck studying and learning this amazing language!**
